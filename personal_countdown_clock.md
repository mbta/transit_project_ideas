# Personal Countdown Clock

## Description

Make a website with a countdown clock to show predictions for the route and stop that you use most. If thereâ€™s information that would be useful for you (like crowding data, or a commuter rail train number, or how the prediction compares with the scheduled time), include it.

You can use as inspiration the new e-ink screens, the commuter rail departure board, the big black countdown clocks in subway and bus stations, or the number of other places MBTA shows predictions. But while those have to work for all riders, you should focus on the routes and information that would be useful for you.

Then bookmark the website on your phone and use it on your commute!
