## Description
Use the MBTA’s [GTFS Feed](https://www.mbta.com/developers/gtfs) to make a website that displays timetables for a route with trips on a given day. You can use as inspiration the commuter rail timetables displayed on [mbta.com](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/CR-Fairmount/timetable).

## Data Sources
The [MBTA’s GTFS](https://github.com/mbta/gtfs-documentation/blob/master/reference/gtfs.md) Feed consists of a series of [text files in a standard format](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) that represent the system’s static schedule (along with other geographic information). For this project, the files of interest are:
- [calendar.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#calendartxt)
- [calendar_dates.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#calendar_datestxt)
- [routes.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#routestxt)
- [route_patterns.txt](https://github.com/mbta/gtfs-documentation/blob/master/reference/gtfs.md#route_patternstxt)
- [trips.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#tripstxt)
- [stop_times.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#stop_timestxt)
- [stops.txt](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#stopstxt)
