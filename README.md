# Transit Coding Projects for Beginners
After learning the basics of programming, building a program that does something useful is a great way to improve your skills.

But what should you make? As a beginner, it’s not always obvious what is possible to make, let alone what is achievable at your current skill level.

The MBTA’s Customer Technology Department has compiled a list of exciting transit-related projects to help you reach the next level. Each project contains a description, a list of open-data sources, and an estimation of difficulty.
